          When Riley was first born, Joy was the first ever emotion created. She
          then walked towards the control console, which at the time consisted
          of only one button. The instant she pressed it, infant Riley began
          smiling. However, 33 seconds later, Riley began crying. Joy soon
          realized that Sadness has arrived and pressed the button. When Joy
          looked at her, Sadness introduced herself, and Joy awkwardly moved her
          aside to make Riley happy again.

          Sadness formed 33 seconds after Riley was born, making her cry. Joy
          quickly pushed Sadness out of the way to make Riley happy again. As
          Riley grew, Joy and Sadness were often at odds over Riley's mood.

          Anger was formed when Riley was very young. When Riley was a toddler
          and her dad tried to get her to eat broccoli, Disgust refused. When
          Dad said she couldn't have dessert if she didn't eat her dinner, Anger
          made her throw a tantrum until Dad made the broccoli an airplane,
          getting Riley to eat.

          Disgust was formed when Riley was very young. Her job is to keep Riley
          safe from disgusting things, like broccoli, which Riley refused to eat
          as a toddler until Dad made it into an airplane.

        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Fear was created in Riley's mind when she was very young. His job was
          to keep her safe by monitoring hazards around her, such as a power
          cord that she could trip over. As Riley grew, he continued to keep her
          safe and celebrated her not dying each day as she went to sleep.
